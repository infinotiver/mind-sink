# Mind Sink - Project Branches

## Branch Strategy

We use a simplified Git Flow for this project:

### Main Branches

- **`main`** - Production branch
  - Always deployable
  - Protected (requires PR + CI checks)
  - Auto-deploys to Render on merge

- **`develop`** (optional) - Integration branch
  - For staging multiple features
  - Use if you want to test multiple features together before production

### Feature Branches

Create from: `main` (or `develop` if using)

Naming conventions:
- **Features:** `feature/feature-name`
  - Example: `feature/add-dark-mode`
  - Example: `feature/oauth-login`

- **Bug fixes:** `fix/bug-description`
  - Example: `fix/broken-image-upload`
  - Example: `fix/oauth-redirect-error`

- **Hotfixes:** `hotfix/critical-fix`
  - Example: `hotfix/security-patch`
  - Use for urgent production fixes

- **Documentation:** `docs/doc-topic`
  - Example: `docs/update-readme`

- **Refactoring:** `refactor/area-name`
  - Example: `refactor/api-client`

- **Experiments:** `experiment/idea-name`
  - Example: `experiment/new-ui-layout`

## Workflow Commands

### Starting New Work

```powershell
# Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Start coding!
```

### Saving Work

```powershell
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat: add description of your feature"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Opening Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Pull requests" â†’ "New pull request"
3. Select your branch
4. Fill out PR template
5. Create PR
6. Wait for CI checks
7. Request review if needed

### After PR is Merged

```powershell
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Delete remote branch (if not auto-deleted)
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep branches short-lived** - Merge within a few days
2. **One feature per branch** - Easier to review and revert if needed
3. **Sync frequently** - Rebase on main to avoid conflicts
4. **Write clear commit messages** - Use conventional commits
5. **Test locally before pushing** - Run `pre-commit-checks` task

## Conventional Commits

Format: `<type>: <description>`

Types:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `style:` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add user profile page
fix: resolve OAuth callback error
docs: update CI/CD guide
style: format backend with black
refactor: extract API client helper functions
chore: update dependencies
```

## Syncing with Main

If main gets ahead of your branch:

```powershell
# On your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# Get latest from main
git fetch origin main

# Rebase your work on top of main
git rebase origin/main

# Force push (only on your feature branch!)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Dealing with Conflicts

If you have merge conflicts:

```powershell
# During rebase, conflicts will be marked
# Open conflicted files in VS Code
# Resolve conflicts (VS Code shows nice UI)
# Stage resolved files
git add .

# Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Push changes
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Emergency Rollback

If production has issues after merge:

```powershell
# On main branch
git checkout main

# Revert the problematic merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Push to trigger immediate redeployment
git push origin main
```

## Useful Git Commands

```powershell
# See current branch and status
git status

# See branch list
git branch -a

# See commit history
git log --oneline --graph --all

# See what changed
git diff

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard all local changes
git reset --hard origin/main
```
